Description: EME wide-block encryption for Go.
 EME for Go is a wide-block encryption mode developed by Halevi and
 Rogaway in 2003 [eme]. (see references below)
 .
 EME uses multiple invocations of a block cipher to construct a new cipher
 of bigger block size (in multiples of 16 bytes, up to 2048 bytes).
